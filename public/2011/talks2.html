Quality is one of the most important factors in deriving business value from software. However, many teams find it difficult to incorporate the appropriate quality and testing practices into their development processes. A test strategy helps create a shared understanding of what testing will be required, and how and when it will be executed.<br />
                    <br />
The Ruby and Rails communities have embraced testing and code quality as core values, and a rich ecosystem of tools has developed. Despite this support, many developers and teams overlook the creation of a test strategy as it is thought to be an unnecessary overhead that is traditionally associated with formal/waterfall style development methodologies. However, a well developed Test Strategy can be the difference between great software and a maintenance nightmare.<br />
                    <br />
This presentation will explain the process of defining quality (internal and external) for Ruby and Rails applications including metrics and targets. It will then explain the process for creating and executing a Test Strategy that ensures the intended quality objectives are achieved. Additionally, it will explain how to align a Test Strategy with the typical practices of a team using Agile or Lean methods.<br />

Ruby on Rails is a famously opinionated framework that handles ninety percent of the problems a typical web application faces. But what about the last ten percent? Every app has to jump off the Rails eventually, whether that means integrating with an external web service, importing data from another database, or providing enhanced search functionality. In this talk I'll lead you through some patterns for handling those cases, and discuss certain features of Rails 3 that let you leverage the best pieces of the core framework without resorting to ugly hacks. Finally we'll discuss what a new, more modular core framework means for a post-Rails world.

                      The presenters, Chiku and Habib, were team members on a distributed Agile Software project. Their job was to quickly write mission critical Rails applications, and they practiced various aspects of Continuous Delivery. Over the duration of this project, they noticed the evolution of interesting patterns that were thought to be great ideas. Many were, some weren't.<br />
                      <br />
                      Chiku and Habib will be pair-presenting their learnings in a way that mirrors the eternal tussle that a developer faces daily - convenience versus quality. One of them will assume the role of a devil and persuasively present a code-fragment that mirrored one such anti-pattern. The other will then take over as an angel and explain the problem inherent in that code-fragment, and proceed to clean it up. They will then swap roles and proceed to the next point.<br />
                      <br />
                      At the end of this presentation the audience will have the knowledge of identifying and subsequently fixing similar manifestations of these problems in their code.

                      <a href="http://test-load-balancer.github.com/">Test Load Balancer (TLB)</a> is a tool that can automatically partition tests into multiple subsets, each one of which can be executed in parallel. The execution can happen on different physical/virtual machines or on the same machine as different processes or threads. The more the partitions, the less the number of tests executed on each one, and since all of the partitions start at the same time (and finish almost at the same time) overall test-execution time gets divided by the number of partitions you make. Test-running is by far the longest step in most (if not all) builds, and cutting down test-running time speeds up the build and hence the feedback loop. TLB can be used for any kind of test-suite - unit, integration or functional tests.<br />
                      <br />
                      In addition to balancing, TLB does other interesting things like re-order tests within a subset (set of tests that run on a partition) before they are executed. For instance, it re-arranges tests to execute failing ones (that failed in the previous build) first, hence ensuring early feedback.<br />
                      <br />
                      Most build servers (like Hudson, Go, TeamCity, Bamboo, etc.) and even tools like capistrano/cluster-ssh provide parallel execution capability (capability to execute command(s) on different machines at the same time). However, parallelization of tests needs a tool that can decide what tests need to be run in each such parallely running process across machines. This is where TLB comes in.<br />
                      <br />
                      This talk will introduce the audience to TLB concepts and include a demo of using TLB to partition RSpec and Test::Unit suites. It'll also include a case-study on how TLB helped cut build time from approximately 70 minutes to 11 minutes (which can of course be further reduced) just by throwing more hardware at it.

Ruby on Rails is a famously opinionated framework that handles ninety percent of the problems a typical web application faces. But what about the last ten percent? Every app has to jump off the Rails eventually, whether that means integrating with an external web service, importing data from another database, or providing enhanced search functionality. In this talk I'll lead you through some patterns for handling those cases, and discuss certain features of Rails 3 that let you leverage the best pieces of the core framework without resorting to ugly hacks. Finally we'll discuss what a new, more modular core framework means for a post-Rails world.

Brian Guthrie has been writing bad Ruby code for five years, every line of it worse than the last. He started his Ruby career in Boston, and after joining ThoughtWorks went on to write increasingly bad Ruby code in Chicago, New York, Texas, California, and India. He is currently writing the worst Ruby code of his career in Melbourne, Australia. He is thrilled to return once more to India to share his mistakes with the vibrant Ruby community there, in the sincere and humble spirit of collective mistake-repetition avoidance.
